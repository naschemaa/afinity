## What's afnity?
afinity is an upcomming software that will make you able to manage your Software "Product Keys".
It will help you to filtrer them by sotware name, version and even more.

### Features

## When will the source code be available on GitHub?
To be honest, I don't have any precise date. However, the first upload might be when I'll finish a stable version.

Thank you.

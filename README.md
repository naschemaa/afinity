It will help you to filtrer them by sotware name, version and even more.

### Features:

## When will the first version be available on GitHub?
To be honest, I don't have any precise date. However, the first (actual) upload might occur when I'll finish a stable version.
I'll at least be realeasing some files.

Thank you.
